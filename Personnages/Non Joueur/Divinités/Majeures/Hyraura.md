# Hyraura
Hyraura is a greatly celebrated and often feared goddess. Death, heritage and journey are the main three elements this divine being is associated with and she's often considered to be athletic and understanding.  
Often depicted as tall, slim, old and glowing Hyraura is usually worshipped through chants and vows.  
  
There's one main place for those craving the power potentially given by Hyraura, but natural altars and worn symbols are probably the most commonly form of worship.  
Worshippers are many and tend to come in the form of politicians and artists and outsiders are often less welcome among followers of this goddess. Even if the right chants and vows cannot be abided by.  
  
Hyraura has no desire for lovers. Which only fuels the power Hyraura could potentially provide, but lovers will often unite when either one is under scrutiny.
