God speech

```
Tell me, Odysseus,
If I were to make you choose
The lives of your men and crew or your own,
Why do I think they'll loose?

Enlighten me, King of Ithacca,
Since hunger was far too great,
I wonder who'd take the weight of the damned
And suffer a gruesome fate to the

Thunder bringer, here to ring your
Ears until you're deaf with fear and
Spear you while your death is near.

Lightning wielder, here to yield your
Time, for you have passed your prime,
Sublime you for your act of crime.

Pride is a damsel in distress
Hiding away where only I can undress her
Try all she can not to confess
In the end, it's all the same once I apply all the pressure

Thunder, bring her through the wringer
Show her i'm the judgement call
The one who makes her kingdom fall
Lightning, wield her, use and yield her
Show her what she can't conceal
For true nature will be revealed
